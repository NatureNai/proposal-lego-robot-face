# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

LEGO ROBOT FACE PROJECT

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A MOTORIZED FACE TRAINED TO CHANGE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS BY VIEWING DIFFERENT OBJECTS WITH A PICAMERA

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
From https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-robot-face
I will learn:
- To build more complex mechanisms using LEGOÂ®
- To use a machine learning library to recognise images
- To use dictionary data structures to control facial expressions
A lot of this project has been taking direct instructions from the website link mentioned above. The code focuses on using the buildhat, and LEGO motors to bring the face to life. My goal for this project is to access the TensorFlow code and create a machine learning code that will recognize my facial expressions and have the robot face change to match them.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
No matter what, I plan to have the robot face work as instructed by https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-robot-face

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
My best outcome is to be able to start working on the TensorFlow code

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- I need to continue to build the face. 
- Work on my soldering skills
- Research TensorFlow code and implementation
